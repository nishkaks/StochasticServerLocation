## Scenario Decomposition Algorithm for 0-1 Stochastic Server Location Problem
In this project we solve the Stochastic Server Location Problem (SSLP) using the scenario decomposition algorithm for stochastic 0-1 programs. The optimal solution is found by iteratively exploring and cutting-off candidate solutions obtained from solving scenario subproblems. This method requires little co-ordination between scenario subproblems and can be easily implemented in a distributed framework.
